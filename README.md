# Webby Calculator 🧮

## 📌 Overview
**Webby Calculator** is a responsive, web-based calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations. It was developed as part of a capstone project to demonstrate front-end web development skills and AI-assisted code generation.

This app is lightweight, clean, and accessible across all devices.

## ✨ Features
- Real-time arithmetic operations
- Responsive layout (desktop and mobile)
- Clean UI with intuitive buttons
- Reset/Clear function

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- HTML

- Vercel (Deployment)

## 🤖 AI Support Explanation
During development, I used **IBM Granite AI** and **ChatGPT** to:
- Generate boilerplate HTML/CSS/JS
- Fix layout bugs and logic errors
- Optimize code readability and structure

> AI was only used in development, not embedded in the final app.
